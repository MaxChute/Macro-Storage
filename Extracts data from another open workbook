'Setting up my different sheets with variable names so I can use the with function and shorten code later on.
'If a variable is not initialed specifically (such as x, i, z, x1 in this example) it is saved as a varient type that
'is similar to an array. It works well with numbers and ranges and is the most flexible data type for VBA.
'The other popular data type you might use is string variables (letters and words, but can be numbers but you can't add two strings together).
